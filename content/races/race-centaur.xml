		<description>
			<p>On the plains, in the forests, and across the steppes live creatures who blend humanoid and equine aspects. Centaurs are neither man nor beast, but occupy a strange niche in both the civilized and natural worlds. They are born with grace befitting a human king, but are possessed of the fierce savagery of a wild stallion. Centaurs are a scattered race, roaming in small clan groups from the Rothenian Plain (where their numbers are great) to the court of the young Valeran Emperor, whom several serve as personal guards. But they also have a reputation for banditry and bullying, and most cultures consider them dangerous.</p>
			<p class="indent">Centaurs are largely a nomadic people. Their archery is excellent and their healing arts are well advanced. Because they have little interest in magic or in writing, other cultures sometimes disregard centaurs, but they do so at their peril. Large centaur hordes have smashed baronies and even small nations flat</p>
			<h4>Raiding and Banditry</h4>
			<p>Upon reaching the age of majority, all young adult centaurs embark on their “bandit years,” a practicedesigned to siphon off those who are particularly troublesome and give some experience to more agreeable colts and fillies. These young centaurs run free, away from the clan groups, to exorcise their aggression and immaturity. At the end of this period, they can choose to remain outside their clan or horde, or they can return with the understanding that they have tamed their wild ways—at least to the degree that’s acceptable to centaur society.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most young adults choose to return after their bandit years, though the occasional centaur leaves the horde permanently out of curiosity, romance with another race, or any number of other factors. Young centaurs of the same age go on their bandit years together, with instructions from the clan chief about when they’ll be allowed to return.</p>
			<p class="indent">Centaurs believe in personal property, but they also believe that a person who claims to own something should be strong enough to defend it. They never steal from their clan, but anyone else is fair game. Shipments or supplies of grain and alcohol are their favorite targets.</p>
			<p class="indent">During a raid, centaurs take advantage of their speed, maneuverability, and skill in archery. They use diversions to draw defenders away from targets, or use heavy volumes of arrows to keep them pinned down.</p>
			<p class="indent">he bandit years are the time when centaurs drink most heavily. Within the clan, celebrations can be shockingly raucous, but everyday life is not. During the bandit years, however, young centaurs are drunk more often than not. This constant inebriation fuels more raids, fights, and reckless behavior</p>
			<p class="indent">The bandit years are also the time when centaurs are most likely to take up a life of adventuring, even if only for a little while. Many centaurs spend their bandit years not strictly as bandits but as wanderers and adventurers, eventually returning to their clans with loot and stories.</p>

				<h4 style="color:rgb(154, 44, 32)">Centaur Size and Damage</h4>
				<p>Large creatures are challenging to balance as playable races, because they have innate advantages that let them outshine smaller races in combat. The centaur is interesting in this regard because, despite their Large size, their upper bodies and arms are human-sized, so they use standard weapons. This creates an opportunity to design in the Large creature space without risking a catastrophic balance shift from creatures swinging enormous weapons, or requiring a list of drawbacks to make them “balanced” (read: unplayable and no fun).</p>

			<h4>Centaur Names</h4>
			<p>Centaur names are similar in many ways to elven names, but they emphasize synonyms for speed, strength, and daring. They sometimes incorporate a long list of deed names, but those are seldom trotted out except during formal occasions and when issuing challenges.</p>
			<p><b>Male Names.</b> Barrazu, Farrushi, Gaddir, Gadjay, Harunmaza, Himfel, Lahza, Muhktif, Seflenn, Zadat</p>
			<p><b>Female Names.</b> Ammida, Bassara, Firnala, Imudeema, Lahga, Leezai, Rashij, Simdisa, Tazgizi, Tifalza</p>
